# Graphical_Simulator_For_Resource_Allocation_Graph
This project is an interactive graphical simulator that visually represents Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs) to help understand deadlock detection and avoidance in operating systems. It allows users to add processes, resources, and simulate requests and allocations dynamically.
